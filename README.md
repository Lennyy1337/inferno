# Inferno Server-Side

**Inferno was a private server-side with an external frontend. Feel free to use this for whatever you want, I don't really care.**

## Features

- **Execution**
- **Login/Sign up**
- **Advanced fake game detection**

## How to Use

You will need to code your own frontend to use this, as this is only an API.

  ```bash
  npm i
  ```
